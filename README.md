### Overview
The bonsai tree project is tomagachi like desk tree. The tree "grows" on a small led grid. First the branches, then the leaves, then the leaves turn red and fall off one by one. The idea is for it to sit on a desk and growth over the course of a week. On monday you start the tree, and by Friday it's is done growing.

The first iteration used a [Bicolor LED Matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/product/902) from Adafruit. The yellow led represets the branch, the green the leaves, and the red the leaves changing colors. The code for this iteration can be found in the v1 folder.

The second iteration is based on the same idea but implemeted in an rgb hex grid similar to the one seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po9i8U6nh0U). This will give us more color control and brightness control of individual pixels which will help greatly for textures.
