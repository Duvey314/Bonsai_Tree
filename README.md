# Bonsai_Tree
The bonsai tree project is basically a bonsai tomagachi. The tree will grow on its own, all you can do is prune banch the branches and leaves to try and make a tree that you like. Once the branches are grown, it will add leaves. After the leaves are added they will all change colors to red, then each one will softly float to the ground. The idea is for it to sit on a desk and growth over the course of a week. On monday you start the tree, and by Friday it's is done growing.
